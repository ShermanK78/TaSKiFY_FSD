## Installation and Local Setup

In this section, we'll provide step-by-step instructions for users to install and run the application on their local machines. This includes the necessary configuration steps, such as modifying MongoDB URIs and API keys.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShermanK78/taskify.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd taskify
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the required dependencies for both the server and client:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

To make the application work on your local machine, you need to configure the following settings:

#### MongoDB Configuration

1. You should have a MongoDB database up and running. You can set up a free MongoDB database at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

2. A. Once you have your MongoDB credentials, create a Project, then click to ‘Connect’ .
    B. Select ‘Shell’, download Mongo DB Shell [if required], and follow the instructions.
    C. Once logged in, note the ‘Connecting to:’ URI [see below]
       

```bash
Current Mongosh Log ID: [***OMITTED***]
Connecting to:       mongodb+srv://<credentials>@[***OMITTED***].[***OMITTED***].mongodb.net/?appName=mongosh+1.10.5
Using MongoDB:          6.0.11 (API Version 1)
Using Mongosh:          1.10.5
```
 D. Copy the URL Suffix below:

```bash
@[***OMITTED***].[***OMITTED***].mongodb.net/?appName=mongosh+1.10.5
```
 F. Navigate to the dbConfig.js file, and add YOUR suffix [in the example below, mine is: @hypdevfullstackdev001.5er5ja1.mongodb.net/?appName=mongosh+1.10.5]` to the #mongoose.connect method below:
```bash
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
require("dotenv").config();

const MONGODB_USERNAME = process.env.MONGODB_USERNAME;
const MONGODB_PASSWORD = process.env.MONGODB_PASSWORD;

async function connectToDatabase() {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(`mongodb+srv://${MONGODB_USERNAME}:${MONGODB_PASSWORD}@hypdevfullstackdev001.5er5ja1.mongodb.net/?appName=mongosh+1.10.5`, {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true
        });

        console.log('MongoDB connected successfully');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
    }
}

connectToDatabase(); // Call the async function to establish the connection

module.exports = mongoose; // Export the mongoose instance
```

3. **Server & API configuration:**

   In the project directory, navigate to the server folder:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

   Create a ‘.env’ file within the server folder. Open this file using a text editor.

4. Using the file structure below, create the required variables, then input the required values. The MongoDB values can be obtained from your Mongo DB credentials, the SECRET_KEY is any string of your choosing, without spaces or special characters that are not URL-encoded. 

```bash
MONGODB_USERNAME=Your MongoDB Username
MONGODB_PASSWORD=Your MongoDB Password
TOKEN_SECRET=Your Secret Key
```

```
### Starting the Application

Now that you have cloned the repository, installed dependencies, and configured the necessary settings, follow these steps to start the application locally:

1. **Start the Server:**

   Navigate to the server directory: 

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

   run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server should start at `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the Client:**

   Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

   Run the following command to start the client:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The client should start at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Testing

You can run tests for the application using the following commands:

- **Server Tests:** In the server directory, run `npx jest db.test.js` to execute server tests.

- **Client Tests:** In the client directory, run `npm test` to run client tests.

That's it! You now have the application running locally on your machine.
