Please note:

1.The root/package.json script on 'https://github.com/ShermanK78/TaSKiFY_FSD' was modified for building and subsequent deployment, as Render.com does not support the 'concurrently' package. 

2.Essentially this means that the app in the GitHub repository needs to be started manually by navigating to each folder and starting them seperately. 
**NB**: The MongoDB Connection will not function correctly, as the '.env file' has been added to '.gitignore' for security purposes, and is therefore not present in the repository.

3.The zipped file in this 'Compulsory Task 1' folder, uses concurrently and can therefore be started from the main project folder '/taskify/' using 'npm start'.

You may use mine, and other fictitious email addresses and passwords to navigate the app[the deployed version on Render.com], during your review:
